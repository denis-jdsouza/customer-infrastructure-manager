# ‚öôÔ∏è Customer Infrastructure Manager

An automation framework designed to orchestrate and manage customer-specific cloud environments across Kubernetes (EKS), RDS and S3.

It provides a standardized way to bring environments up or down, as well as capture and record their state for auditing, rollback and CI/CD integrations.

_This automation is typically run within a CI/CD pipeline (like Jenkins) to ensure controlled, traceable infrastructure changes._

## üéØ Purpose:
The tool acts as an orchestrator that integrates:
* **Kubernetes (EKS):** Scale up/down deployments (e.g. frontend/backend services).
* **Amazon RDS:** Start or stop database instances tied to the customer environment.
* **Amazon S3:** Record and retrieve historical states and action metadata.

## üß† Use Cases
* Automatically **suspend non-production environments** during off-hours to save cost.
* **Restore** a customer‚Äôs environment to its previous state.
* **Validate** infrastructure status via Jenkins jobs or manual runs.

## ‚öôÔ∏è How It Works
At its core, the automation performs actions based on an environment variable called ACTION, which can be one of:
* **up** ‚Äì Brings up an environment by restoring deployments and database to their last known state.
* **down** ‚Äì Brings down an environment by scaling deployments to 0 replicas and stopping the database.
* **get_env_state** ‚Äì Fetches and displays the current environment state (deployments, RDS and application status).

## üí° Key Features
* **Controlled Scaling (Down):** The `down` action scales K8s deployments to zero replicas and shuts down the associated RDS instance.
* **Stateful Recovery (Up):** The `up` action retrieves the last known replica count from S3 and scales K8s deployments back to that state while starting the RDS instance.
* **Reliable RDS Status:** The system automatically **polls the RDS instance** when it is in a transient state (e.g., 'starting', 'stopping') to ensure the orchestration waits for a stable state ('available' or 'stopped') before proceeding.
* **Idempotent Actions:** Prevents consecutive execution of the same action (e.g., prevents running `up` immediately after another `up`).
* **State Tracking:** Records granular pre and post action environment state (K8s deployment, RDS status) to S3.
* **Auditability:** Every action is logged in `actions.json` with a timestamp, CI build ID, user, and the desired state for full traceability.

## üìÅ Project Structure

The project is divided into logical modules within the `src/` directory:

| File Name | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| `main.py` | **Entry Point.** Parses environment variables and orchestrates the 'up', 'down', or 'get\_env\_state' action via the `InfraOrchestrator`. |
| `orchestrator.py` | **Core Logic.** Contains the `InfraOrchestrator` class, which coordinates actions across K8s, RDS, S3 and Apphealth modules. |
| `k8s.py` | **K8sManager.** Handles Kubernetes operations, including deployment status checks and scaling resources. |
| `rds.py` | **RDSManager.** Manages AWS RDS operations, such as checking the database status and performing start/stop actions. |
| `s3.py` | **S3StateFileManager.** Provides functionality to record and retrieve JSON-based state and action history from S3 bucket. |
| `apphealth.py` | **AppHealthChecker.** Checks the health status of an application based on it's health check URL after deployment changes. |
| `kubeconfig_helper.py` | A utility to update the local Kubeconfig file for connecting to the target EKS cluster. |

***

## ‚öôÔ∏è Setup and Configuration

### Prerequisites

Before running the automation, ensure you have:
1.  **Python 3.x** installed.
2.  **AWS Credentials** configured locally or in your CI environment with below permissions:
```json
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Sid": "EKSClusterAccess",
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Action": [
        "eks:DescribeCluster"
      ],
      "Resource": "*"
    },
    {
      "Sid": "RDSManagement",
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Action": [
        "rds:StartDBInstance",
        "rds:StopDBInstance",
        "rds:DescribeDBInstances"
      ],
      "Resource": "*"
    },
    {
      "Sid": "S3StateManagement",
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Action": [
        "s3:PutObject",
        "s3:GetObject",
        "s3:ListBucket"
      ],
      "Resource": [
        "arn:aws:s3:::<s3-bucket-name>",
        "arn:aws:s3:::<s3-bucket-name>/*"
      ]
    }
  ]
}

```
3.  Installed dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`

_Note:_
* Replace 's3-bucket-name' with the actual bucket name used in your environment (e.g. customer-infra-manager).
* You‚Äôll need appropriate Kubernetes RBAC permissions within the cluster (to scale deployments, read namespaces, etc.).

### Environment Variables

The `main.py` script requires the following environment variables to be set before execution (e.g. in a CI stage or via the included test `.env` file):

| Variable | Description | Example |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `EKS_CLUSTER` | The name of your target Kubernetes cluster. | `eks-dev-cluster` |
| `AWS_REGION` | The AWS region for your EKS cluster & RDS instance. | `us-east-1` |
| `CUSTOMER` | Identifier for the customer/account context. | `alpha` |
| `ENVIRONMENT` | Identifier for customer deployment environment. | `dev` |
| `ACTION` | The desired operation: `up`, `down`, or `get_env_state`. | `up` |
| `BUILD_NUMBER` | CI/CD build ID for tracking (increment this number for each run). | `10` |
| `BUILD_USER` | CI/CD user ID for tracking (optional, but recommended). | `jenkins-user` |
| `S3_BUCKET_NAME` | S3 bucket for storing customer environemnt state. | `customer-infra-manager` |
| `S3_REGION` | The AWS region for S3 bucket. | `us-east-1` |

***

## üìù Customizing the automation

The core infrastructure identifiers are defined in the **`main.py`** file and must be updated to match your specific setup.

Look for the `üéØ USER CONFIGURATION SECTION üéØ` in **`main.py`** and modify the following variables:

### 1. Infrastructure Identifiers

| Variable | Default Format | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **`NAMESPACE_FORMAT`** | `customer-env` | The Kubernetes namespace the deployments are in. |
| **`RDS_IDENTIFIER_FORMAT`** | `customer-env-rds` | The identifier for your RDS database instance. |

### 2. K8s Deployments List

This is the list of K8s deployments the automation will manage.

```python
# Add or remove entries here to match the number of deployments you want to manage.
# Format: [("deployment-name", "namespace", "app-health-check-url")]
DEPLOYMENTS = [
    ("frontend-deployment", NAMESPACE_FORMAT, f".../healthz"),
    ("backend-deployment", NAMESPACE_FORMAT, f".../healthz")
]
```

### 3. S3 State Paths

These variables define the file names and the S3 paths used for storing environment state and action history.

```python
# S3 state file names
prestate_file = "pre-state.json"   # State before the action is performed
poststate_file = "post-state.json" # State after the action is performed
actions_file = "actions.json"      # Records metadata about the action

# S3 paths used for storing environment state (customizable path structure)
S3_PATHS_FORMAT = [
    # ... path structure using envs['eks_cluster'], envs['customer'], etc. ...
]
```

### 4. Actions Data
This dictionary defines the data recorded into the actions.json file.

```bash
actions = {
    "timestamp": timestamp,                   # UTC time when the action was initiated
    "jenkins_build": envs['jbuild'],          # Build number/ID from the CI system
    "jenkins_user": envs['juser'],            # User who triggered the build
    "customer": envs['customer'],             # Customer identifier
    "environment": envs['env'],               # Environment (e.g., staging, prod)
    "desired_state": envs['action']           # The action performed ('up', 'down', or 'get_env_state')
}
```

### ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Usage
The project is executed via a single command after setting the required environment variables:
```bash
# 1. Bring the environment up (scale-up)
# Note: 'up' is disallowed in the first run or immediately after another 'up'.
export ACTION="up"
source .env && python3 src/main.py

# 2. Take the environment down (scale-down)
export ACTION="down"
source .env && python3 src/main.py

# 3. Check the current state (without taking action)
export ACTION="get_env_state"
source .env && python3 src/main.py
```

### üíª Example Execution Output
The automation provides verbose, color-coded output detailing the state before and after an action, along with a log of S3 state recording.

This snippet shows the flow for the **'up'** action:
